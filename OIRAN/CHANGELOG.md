# Changelog

## [OIRAN API 2.4.0-dev / live-probe 0.2.0-dev] - 2026-10-28

### Added

- Added an atomic, mode-`0600` probe registry seeded with `oiran-vprobe-local-01` and an Operator-plus-CSRF `POST /api/v1/probes` contract.
- Added registry-backed capture-interface roles while keeping unregistered roles explicitly `null`.

### Changed

- Probe liveness now derives only from measured capture ingestion or packet timestamps; probes without a real heartbeat remain `PENDING`, offline, and expose a `null` heartbeat.
- Live dataset capture interface and size evidence now remain `null` when no capture job supplies those values.
- Raw PCAP download now fails closed with `403 DOWNLOAD_POLICY_PENDING` pending a subscriber-identity-safe export policy.

### Validation

- Added API tests for truthful liveness, persistent creation, duplicate and invalid payload rejection, CSRF enforcement, role mapping, absent capture evidence, and download denial.
- No production service, external capture, UE, Open5GS component, or dataset was modified.

## Release consolidation V1.1 - lossless continuous checkpoint resume

- Preserve evidence-backed session identifiers when live activity credit expires or a continuous import is finalized.
- Validate and merge the last durable continuous dataset checkpoint before publishing the next atomic dataset generation.
- Deduplicate observations by stable semantic event identifier and retain only call flows whose event references remain present.
- Fail closed on an invalid checkpoint without replacing the prior event store.
- Added restart, new-data, idempotent replay, five-session retention, and invalid-checkpoint regression coverage.

## E2E-002 - Atomic derived-dataset registration

- Added an authenticated, allowlisted import endpoint that accepts only a derived dataset identifier.
- Verifies source capture identity, all source PCAP hashes and packet counts, artifact hashes, schema/decoder compatibility, provenance, sessions, and correlation evidence before registration.
- Stages and atomically renames the complete dataset, callflows and registry update.
- Supports idempotent re-import and rejects conflicting dataset identifiers.
- Added authenticated candidate browser coverage for derived dataset visibility, exact tunnel evidence, strong associations, unknown NG-U evidence and packet provenance.

## E2E-002 - Evidence-based cross-interface correlation

- Normalized structurally verified NGAP UP transport endpoint and TEID evidence.
- Added typed exact-tunnel and strong-context correlation edges with scope, limitations, and packet provenance.
- Added ambiguity rejection and kept missing NG-U evidence explicitly unknown.
- Exposed evidence type and limitations in Call Flow and Correlation Studio.
- Added an immutable-source offline replay producing a separate 92-event derived dataset.

All notable OIRAN vProbe changes are recorded here. Versions follow Semantic Versioning.

## [S5.5.1/1.0.1-dev] - 2026-10-26

### Fixed

- Defined the shared Rust `MAX_CAPTURE_PLANES = 4` contract and applied it independently in the live-probe API validator and isolated Capture Helper.
- Made the four-plane default (`N2`, `SBI`, `N4`, `N3`) valid while retaining one-, two- and three-plane compatibility.
- Preserved strict rejection of duplicate, unknown, unavailable and more-than-four logical planes.
- Added deterministic interface inventories for offline helper/IPC tests while retaining the fixed `/sys/class/net` inventory in production.
- Added explicit Select All and Apply Configuration controls; successful validation is invalidated whenever capture configuration changes.

### Validation

- Passed 172/172 Rust workspace tests, including authenticated HTTP API to Unix IPC to non-acquiring Capture Helper validation.
- Passed 19/19 frontend tests, TypeScript validation and the production frontend build.
- Passed 46/46 browser E2E regressions against an isolated local API and copied read-only registry fixture.

### Safety

- Four-plane storage remains one global bounded reservation: the helper divides the job budget across plane/rotation segments rather than multiplying it.
- No packet socket was opened by the new validation test, and no live capture, simulator execution, production deployment or service restart occurred.

## [S5.5/1.0.0-dev] - 2026-10-26

### Added

- Unified S5.1 SLL2, S5.2 NAS and S5.3 TCP/HTTP2/SBI decoding in one release lineage.
- Fixed, allowlisted SBI capture point (`br-oiran-sbi`, TCP/7777) in the isolated AF_PACKET helper.
- Four-plane POLARIS profile for NG-C, SBI, N4 and NG-U with synchronized capture-group identifiers and per-plane results.
- Capture-group API, per-plane packet/storage/decode status, and four-plane Probe Manager controls.
- SBI-aware Call Flow participants, arrows and conservative E2E status that remains UNKNOWN when either SBI bridge is unproven.

### Validation

- Passed 166 Rust tests and 18 frontend tests; production frontend build and TypeScript validation passed.
- Passed the dedicated four-plane Playwright suite in Light/Dark at 1440x900 and 1920x1080.
- Retained the unchanged 13-file corpus and the multi-IMSI result: six UE contexts, five PDU sessions, six PFCP sessions, zero GTP-U tunnels and no observed cross-UE contamination.

### Safety

- No live capture, simulator execution, production deployment or shared-service restart occurred.
- POLARIS, POLARIS Control, ETV/OTV and certified historical datasets were unchanged.

## [S5.3/1.0.0-dev] - 2026-10-26

### Added

- Bounded bidirectional TCP reconstruction with sequence-aware retransmission, duplicate, out-of-order, gap, timeout and provenance handling.
- Native HTTP/2 frame and multiplexed-stream decoding, including HEADERS/CONTINUATION/DATA and stateful HPACK through the MIT-licensed `hpack` crate.
- Sanitized SBI request/response events for observed Nsmf PDUSession and Namf Communication operations, with JSON/multipart field extraction and explicit TLS/unresolved states.
- Conservative SCP-routing and cross-interface correlation hooks that reject PDU Session ID-only and timestamp-only associations.
- SBI participants and request/response messages in the existing Call Flow schema without synthesizing unseen logical hops.

### Validation

- Replayed the unchanged 13-file, 4,205-packet corpus with SHA256 verification before and after.
- Matched 2,316/2,316 HTTP/2 frames and 766/766 independently comparable fields against TShark 4.2.2; 26 fields remain unresolved because capture begins after HPACK dynamic-table state was established.
- Observed 48 TCP connections, 708 HTTP/2 streams, 198 transactions and 20 prioritized operations.
- Preserved six UE contexts and five PDU sessions without observed cross-UE contamination; the N2/SBI/N4 bridge remains uncertified because explicit cross-layer identifiers are absent.

### Safety

- No live capture, simulator execution, production deployment or service restart occurred.
- POLARIS, POLARIS Control, ETV/OTV and the reference corpus were unchanged.

## [S5.2/1.0.0-dev] - 2026-10-26

### Added

- Native bounded Rust dispatch for 5GMM (`0x7e`) and 5GSM (`0x2e`) with observed Release-17 message identities.
- Safe Type 1/3/4/6, TV, TLV and TLV-E handling for observed NAS fields, including pseudonymized mobile identities, PDU Session ID, PTI, causes, DNN and S-NSSAI.
- Explicit NAS security-envelope classification without key derivation, integrity claims or unauthorized decryption.
- Parent/child NGAP → 5GMM → 5GSM event relationships with inherited packet provenance and compatible event schema 1.4.0 fields.
- Evidence-based procedure attempts that separate retry, failure, success and incomplete results and scope NAS children through their exact NGAP parent.

### Validation

- Replayed the unchanged 13-file, 4,205-packet S5.1 corpus before/after SHA256 verification.
- Parsed 116 NGAP-carried NAS envelopes across the full corpus; 46 plain messages were decoded (24 complete, 22 partial), 10 integrity-only messages were decoded without claiming verification, and 60 ciphered envelopes remained unresolved.
- Achieved 404/464 exact independently comparable TShark fields, with zero mismatch and 60 encrypted/unresolved message-type fields.
- Preserved six UE context lifecycles and five PDU sessions in the multi-IMSI fixture without observed cross-UE contamination.
- Passed 152/152 Rust workspace tests after one documented retry of a pre-existing timing-sensitive worker-runtime queue watermark test.

### Safety

- No live capture, simulator execution, production deployment or service restart occurred.
- POLARIS, POLARIS Control, ETV/OTV and certified historical datasets were unchanged.

## [S5.1/1.0.0-dev] - 2026-10-26

### Added

- Native Linux cooked capture v2 parsing for `LINKTYPE_LINUX_SLL2` / link type 276.
- Network-byte-order parsing and validation for the 20-byte SLL2 header, including protocol, interface index, ARPHRD type, packet type and address metadata.
- Additive event provenance schema 1.3.0 fields for source SHA256, link type and SLL2 metadata.
- Per-interface SLL2 dispatch for PCAPNG and IPv6 extension-header traversal with explicit fragment/ESP limitations.

### Validation

- Replayed the unchanged 13-file, 4,205-packet benchmark corpus after SHA256 verification.
- Decoded 239 LAB NGAP/PFCP/GTP-U message envelopes with exact packet, timestamp, endpoint and message parity against TShark 4.2.2.
- Reconstructed five isolated PDU sessions from the five-UE fixture without cross-UE contamination; cross-interface N2/N4 confidence remains unresolved.
- Added deterministic PCAP, PCAPNG mixed-link, IPv4, IPv6, malformed-header and fuzz-like regression tests.

### Safety

- No live capture, simulator execution, deployment or production service change occurred.
- POLARIS, POLARIS Control, ETV/OTV and historical certified datasets were unchanged.

## [2.3.0-dev] - 2026-10-26

### Fixed

- Normalize historical, captured-live and recovered dataset records behind API 2.3.
- Add explicit dataset scopes to Session Explorer without fallback to an unrelated historical session.
- Scope decode-completeness counts to session-associated events instead of dataset background events.
- Preserve exact dataset identity through Session Explorer and Call Flow navigation.

### Validation

- Added a deterministic, clearly labeled test corpus with three independent UE contexts, PDU sessions, PFCP sessions and GTP-U tunnels.
- Verified composite identity isolation, identifier reuse safety, pagination and zero-session datasets.
- Passed 134 Rust tests, 18 frontend tests and 44 browser workflows.
- Reviewed Light and Dark screenshots at 1440×900 and 1920×1080.

### Safety

- No live capture, simulator traffic, UE process, deployment or production-service restart occurred.
- POLARIS, POLARIS Control, ETV/OTV and certified historical datasets were not changed.

## [1.0.0-dev/OIRAN-P0-LIVE-FINALIZATION-FIX] - 2026-10-25

### Fixed

- Create the derived `dataset/callflows` layout before the first decoded-event write from a freshly finalized helper capture.
- Preserve `FAILED` status for recoverable PCAP evidence until derived processing completes successfully.
- Synchronize terminal helper storage accounting after empty-interface PCAP headers are finalized.
- Show an explicit **View error** action, exact backend failure, and preserved-evidence state for failed capture jobs without linking them to fictitious sessions.
- Finalize normalized-event JSONL, Call Flow exports and dataset manifests using temporary files plus atomic rename.
- Add an idempotent `oiran-recover` command and persistent recovered-dataset registry that never changes the original failed job.

### Validation

- Added clean-root regressions for fully populated N2/N3/N4 captures and captures with an empty N3 interface.
- Added offline timeout, graceful manual Stop, bounded rotation, empty selected interface, partial initialization failure, and failed-job recovery coverage.
- Recovered `live-1792964646320-0003` offline as 50 verified packets and 20 PFCP heartbeat events; the original capture remains `FAILED`.
- No live capture or simulator traffic was executed; original forensic PCAPs and historical certified datasets remain unchanged.

## [1.0.0-dev/OIRAN-P0-ISOLATED-CAPTURE-HELPER] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Native Rust AF_PACKET capture helper with no tcpdump subprocess dependency.
- Unix socket IPC v1 with `SO_PEERCRED` server authorization and client-side helper identity verification.
- Fixed N2/N3/N4 interface enum, bounded request schema, exact job ownership, and explicit `COMPLETED_EMPTY` state.
- Global disk budget, bounded PCAP rotation, atomic manifests, SHA-256 integrity, and persisted helper job records.
- Review-only hardened systemd unit, API drop-in, IPC specification, security review, and deployment/rollback plan.

### Changed

- `live-probe` now uses the isolated IPC adapter and fails closed when its authorized socket is absent.
- The API capture root may use the fixed `/var/lib/oiran/captures` deployment path; arbitrary Web paths remain impossible.
- Unix termination signals are represented separately from process exit codes.

### Safety

- No helper was deployed or started and no live capture or simulator traffic was executed.
- POLARIS, POLARIS Control, ETV/OTV, Open5GS, UERANSIM, historical datasets, Docker, firewall, and routing were unchanged.

## [2.0.0-dev] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Premium dark-default Analyzer shell with complete Light, Dark and System themes.
- Operational Overview, Packet Analyzer, Export & Reports, and Live Monitoring modules.
- Versioned API 2.0 endpoints for probe detail, truthful host/live metrics, packet provenance, public Viewer identity, and fail-closed capture lifecycle validation.
- Evidence-driven Call Flow inspector tabs for decoded fields, ASN.1, restricted raw payload references, canonical JSON, correlation evidence and provenance.
- Responsive visual validation for seven analytical views at 1440×900 and 1920×1080 in both themes.

### Validation

- 97 Rust/API tests, 9 frontend tests and 33 browser workflows pass.
- Certified accounting remains 54 source events, 26 session events, 28 background events and 12 evidence edges.
- Live metrics are `NOT AVAILABLE` and capture controls remain unavailable because no authorized live capture backend is configured.

### Safety

- The certified PCAPs and Call Flow JSON remain checksum-identical.
- No POLARIS, POLARIS Control, ETV/OTV, Open5GS, UERANSIM, Docker, firewall, routing or database resource was modified.

## [1.0.0-dev/S4.2] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Permanent 75/80/85/90 percent disk policy with statvfs byte/inode measurement.
- Fail-closed stateful capture guard, reserved between-poll write budget and bounded 256 MiB × 8 rotation plan.
- Authenticated storage-safety API and measured Probe Manager storage panel.
- Approval-gated five-UE POLARIS scenario manifest and validation reports.

### Safety

- No five-UE scenario, traffic or capture was started because new POLARIS profiles/processes require explicit approval.
- No cleanup, automatic deletion, service restart, database, Docker-network, firewall or route change occurred.

## [1.0.0-dev/S4.1] - 2026-10-24

### Added

- Deterministic multi-UE, multi-PDU, PFCP lifecycle and directional GTP-U tunnel discovery.

- Independent session selection in Call Flow Viewer and conservative incomplete-flow generation.

### Validation

- 85 Rust release tests, 9 frontend tests and 28 browser workflows pass.
- Five-UE/six-PDU synthetic fixture covers concurrent, sequential and incomplete behavior; real multi-UE capture certification remains pending.
- Certified S3.3 call flow and N2/N3/N4 checksums remain unchanged.

### Safety

- POLARIS was read-only; ETV/OTV, Docker networks, databases, routing and capture services were not modified or restarted.
- No additional UE, test traffic or live capture was started.

### Public read-only access update — 2026-10-25

- Removed viewer/admin access tokens and the sign-in screen by explicit operator request.
- Preserved read-only API behavior, disabled live capture controls, sanitized provenance and immutable datasets.

- Responsive 1440×900 and 1920×1080 visual certification, keyboard focus states, dark theme, error/empty/loading states and URL-deep-linked sessions.
- Isolated deployment templates, API contract, security/deployment reports and a 25-workflow browser suite.

### Validation

- 71 Rust/API tests, 8 frontend tests and 25 browser workflows pass.
- Production frontend build and TypeScript checking pass; npm audit reports zero vulnerabilities.
- Certified call flow and PCAP hashes remain unchanged; no Docker, database, firewall, route or persistent-service mutation was performed.

### Added

- Native bounded PCAP and PCAPNG reader with exact per-interface timestamp provenance.
- Ethernet, stacked VLAN, Linux cooked v1, IPv4/IPv6, UDP and SCTP extraction.
- SCTP DATA parsing, association generations, duplicate handling and conservative reassembly.

- Event schema 1.1.0 with deterministic IDs, packet sets, endpoint roles, decode statuses and raw-payload references.
- Offline CLI producing 99 ordered real-capture events and an independent TShark comparison.

### Validation

- 40 unit/regression tests pass.
- Exact packet/header alignment: 37 NGAP, 52 PFCP and 10 GTP-U; zero missing or mismatched messages.
- Full nested IE parity remains partial: 33 NGAP and 12 PFCP events explicitly retain unsupported values.
- Operational N3 remains empty; GTP-U evidence comes from an immutable Open5GS reference under POLARIS.

### Safety

- No benchmark, package installation, service restart or POLARIS/ETV/OTV mutation.

## [1.0.0-dev/S2.1] - 2026-10-24

- Generator-only, independent preloaded fast-path and full-pipeline benchmark isolation.
- Queue-oriented source contract for future PCAP, AF_XDP and DPDK adapters.
- Effective-cpuset-aware automatic/explicit/disabled affinity and worker mask reporting.
- Mandatory fresh receipt from a bounded 15-minute resource safety observer.

### Changed

- `capture-core`, `worker-runtime` and `benchmark-engine` advanced to 0.3.0.
- Processing-only timing no longer contains serial generation, per-packet allocation, queues or shared counters.
- Full-pipeline reporting distinguishes generated, enqueued, processed, explicit drops and in-flight packets.

### Validation

- 21 unit tests passed with no failure; performance runs were deferred because the stability gate did not pass.
- No 25 Gbit/s or 100 Gbit/s capability claim is made.

## [1.0.0-dev/S2] - 2026-10-24

### Added

- Generator-only, pre-generated processing-only and full-pipeline benchmark modes.
- Exact generated = processed + explicit-drop invariant.
- Packet-number sum/XOR, ordered work accumulator and provenance-length validation.
- Four-worker accounting, same-flow ordering and length-mismatch regression tests.
- Complete 1–4 worker, 32–256 batch and 64–1500 byte before/after matrices.

### Changed

- `capture-core` 0.2.0 adds uniquely owned packet buffers while preserving shared replay buffers.
- `worker-runtime` and `telemetry` 0.2.0 aggregate fast-path counters per batch.
- `benchmark-engine` 0.2.0 reports generated packets, length errors and observable work.

### Performance

- Fixed S1 profile (2 workers, batch 64, 250 ms): 1500-byte median increased from 2.694994 to 3.037666 Gbit/s Ethernet-wire equivalent (+12.72%).
- Best accepted three-run median: 3.175694 Gbit/s at 2 workers, batch 256, 1500-byte frames.
- No claim of 25 Gbit/s certification.

### Safety stop

- Further component profiling stopped after an external OTV container replacement/worker exit was observed. S2 status is partial; no OIRAN command modified OTV.

## [1.0.0-dev] - 2026-10-24

### Added

- Eight-crate Rust workspace with independent component versions.
- Immutable packet provenance and batch envelopes.
- Allocation-free Ethernet, VLAN, IPv4, direct-UDP IPv6, UDP and GTP-U classification.
- TEID and tunnel endpoint extraction with strict malformed-length detection.
- Stable software flow/session affinity independent of NIC RSS behavior.
- Bounded per-worker queues, batch execution, CPU affinity, backpressure accounting and graceful shutdown.
- Deterministic replay mode and cache-line-aligned per-worker counters.
- Versioned normalized event model and deterministic decoder plugin contract.
- Safety-bounded synthetic benchmark for 64, 128, 512 and 1500-byte frames.
- Automated integrity, parser, concurrency, saturation, shutdown and replay tests.

### Limitations

- No production capture adapter, SCTP/NGAP/PFCP decoder, dynamic plugin loader or UI in S1.
- No IPv4 fragment or IPv6 extension-header reconstruction.
- Synthetic results are not line-rate certification.

## [1.0.0-dev/S3.2.1] - 2026-10-24

### Added

- Release-aware typed NGAP decoding for observed UE IDs, location, security, S-NSSAI, PDU-session identifiers, cause and selected node/context fields.
- Recursive typed PFCP decoding for the grouped and leaf IEs observed in the selected captures.
- Event-schema 1.2 probe/capture-point identity and explicit EXACT/STRONG/POSSIBLE/UNKNOWN evidence references.
- Field-parity, N3 diagnostic, dataset and correlation-readiness artifacts.

### Changed

- `decoder-ngap` and `decoder-pfcp` advanced to 0.2.0; `event-schema` advanced to 1.2.0-dev.
- Known but untyped PFCP leaves are PARTIAL and unknown IEs are UNSUPPORTED rather than silently decoded.
- The selected PFCP set improved from 40 fully decoded and 12 partial messages to 52 fully decoded and zero partial; NGAP improved from 4/33 to 9/28.

### Validation and safety

- 46 workspace tests pass; 99/99 generated events retain packet provenance and evidence.
- Operational N3 remains empty because no UE user-plane traffic was generated; no POLARIS or ETV/OTV service was changed.
- Full Release-17 NGAP parity and a coherent operational N2/N4/N3 dataset are not claimed.

## [1.0.0-dev/S3.3] - 2026-10-24

### Added

- Independently versioned `session-engine`, `correlation-engine`, `callflow-schema`, `callflow-renderer`, and `oiran-callflow` crates.
- Deterministic UE/PDU/PFCP/GTP-U reconstruction with explicit session, background and unmatched accounting.
- Versioned STRONG N2↔N4 certified-tunnel rules and EXACT N4↔N3 TEID-plus-endpoint rules.
- Canonical Call Flow JSON and standalone interactive HTML with filters, search, zoom, procedure groups, evidence inspector and JSON export.
- Seventeen unit tests for reconstruction, ambiguity, missing data, duplicate handling, provenance, schema, output containment and safe HTML rendering.

### Validation

- All 54 certified source events are preserved: 26 session, 28 background, 0 unmatched, 0 duplicate and 0 extra.
- Twelve evidence-bearing edges reproduce N2↔N4 STRONG, N4↔N3 EXACT and E2E STRONG.
- 63 workspace tests pass; all historical 46 tests remain passing.

### Security

- Subscriber identity remains `UE-A`; no authentication material or unrestricted raw payload is exported.
- HTML has no remote dependency, treats decoded values as text, and script-escapes embedded JSON.

## [1.0.0-dev/OIRAN-LIVE-V1] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Strictly owned, allowlisted Rust live-capture manager for the discovered POLARIS N2, N3 and N4 Linux bridges.

- Reusable native decoder library feeding normalized events, multi-session discovery, correlation and canonical Call Flow outputs after capture finalization.
- Versioned capture validation/start/stop/metrics API with Viewer, Operator and Administrator enforcement.
- Probe Manager controls, real interface inventory, session-scoped token login and honest execution/certification states.

### Safety

- Capture execution is disabled by default and requires `OIRAN_CAPTURE_EXECUTION_ENABLED=1` plus a server-provisioned token hash.
- No live capture or traffic generation was executed in this release; POLARIS, POLARIS Control and ETV/OTV were not changed.
- Job storage is constrained to `/root/OIRAN_VPROBE/runtime/live-captures`; source datasets are never deleted or overwritten.

## [1.0.0-dev/OIRAN-P0-CAPTURE-LIFECYCLE] - 2026-10-25

- Fixed tcpdump output ownership for its restricted service account.
- Run the OIRAN API with the restricted `tcpdump` primary group and grant write access only to each job's PCAP directory, avoiding the broader `CAP_CHOWN` capability.
- Configure the capture helper to retain the already systemd-confined service identity, avoiding a denied tcpdump `setuid/setgid` transition without granting additional capabilities.
- Persist helper PID, exit status and bounded stderr for capture forensics.
- Classify premature helper exit and missing output as failures.
- Represent legitimate empty capture explicitly without generating sessions.
- Synchronize the selected capture panel with authoritative polling state.
- Recover the affected legacy false-success job as failed.

## [2.2.0-dev] - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Strict capture-to-dataset resolution through `GET /api/v1/captures/{capture_id}/context`.
- Exact packet provenance filters for capture, event and packet number.
- Evidence-derived Call Flow participants, directional SVG arrows, procedure controls and a synchronized message index/inspector.
- Honest zero-session and unavailable-dataset investigation states.
- UTC millisecond timestamp formatting and provenance deep links into Packet Analyzer.

### Changed

- Session navigation now persists `capture_id`, `dataset_id`, `session_id`, `probe_id`, technology and selected event in the URL.
- Capture records expose their associated dataset without changing the immutable capture outcome.
- OIRAN API and Web versions advance to 2.2.0-dev.

### Safety

- No decoder, historical dataset, live capture service or external laboratory component was modified or started.
